		<h3>Cubing</h3>
		<p>To start off, I love Cubing. If you do not know what cubing is I reccomend that you go ahead and search it up, but a simple description is simply solving Rubik's Cubes.</p>

		<h3>My Story</h3>
		<p>I got my first "Rubik's Cube" in 2017 with me trying to make patterns 
		and trying to solve a side. I would occasionally challenge myself at the
		time and try to do a pattern on one side (such as a green "L" [Luigi],
		checkerboard patterns, flags, etc.). This is about where I got to before
		it living on my desk for about a year, being a decoration piece on its
		stand with me occasionally solving a side or two, but it remaining mostly 
		unsolved. 2018 is when cubing really started for me, with the GATE test 
		being finished, I had nothing to do, so my mother made me, instead of
		playing video games, to try and solve the Rubik's Cube that sat on my shelf.
		I had no motivation at the time, with me just messing around with the cube
		and being happy if I solved a face. My mother gave my brother the same challenge
		and bought him a Rubik's Cube as well. I sort of forgot about the challenge over
		the next week, but I seemed to gravitate to my Rubik's Cube and mess arouns with
		it more than I used to before. After my brother learnt how to solve the Rubik's Cube,
		it gave me the incentive to start learning, with me being lazy at first, using 
		a Rubik's Cube solver and seeing what it does. It was after a few solves that 
		I realized that it has no pattern that I could learn, so I faced my fears and went
		on the internet and looked for a tutorial. After hours of trying, I found a website
		called "You can do the Cube" and it had some helpful things, such as how to turn the
		cube and not just notation and some simple algorithms. I got to work and started to
		learn the algorithms with me learning how to solve the first layer in a breeze,
		the second layer in about an hour. After this came the most tedious part,
		learning how to solve the last layer.

		<p class = "q"> This was challenging (and sort of still is to this day,
		although I use a different method), as I had to learn quite a few algoritms.
		I pushed through, and I learnt the necessary algorithms, and was 
		able to solve the cube in about 5 minutes. At this point, my brother
		could solve it in about 1 minute. This is where I started to get competi
		tive with my brother, so my times dropped by 4 minutes in about 1 week, 
		so I became competitive with my brother and we would race a lot, but he 
		would just about always win. So, I decided to take this more seriously
		and try and beat him. After 2 weeks of practicing in all of my free time
		, I learnt 2 new methods, CFOP and Roux (I use both methods today as well)
		and I soon averaged under the (magical for me) 1 minute mark, so I was able
		to beat my brother. After this, I kept going as I had the incentive to get faster
		and faster, so soon came under 50 seconds, then under 40 seconds, then 30 seconds,
		and that is where I am today, with me very close to consistantly averaging under
		20 seconds, with me globally averaging 21.47 seconds on 3x3. I now do more events,
		with me being the best at (in the context of the rest of the world) Square-1.
